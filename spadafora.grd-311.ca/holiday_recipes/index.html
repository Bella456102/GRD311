<h2 class="article-head">Baked Brie with Cranberry-Pecan Bacon Crumble&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;This is a starter recipe.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 round brie cheese</li>
      <li>&nbsp;¼ cup apricot preserves</li>
      <li>&nbsp;4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
      <li>&nbsp;¼ cup dried cranberries</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>&nbsp;assorted crackers and fruit slices, for serving</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lay the bacon in a large skillet, then cook over medium heat until golden and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Drain the bacon on paper towels, let cool, then finely chop.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Combine the bacon, pecans, cranberries, apricots, rosemary, vinegar, pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Remove the Brie from its packaging. Cut off the top rind of the round of Brie, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edges (use a sharp knife and go in from above at a slight angle). Discard the rind you have removed. Put the Brie in a small baking dish. Top with some of the cranberry-pecan-bacon crumble, and scatter the rest around the Brie. Cover the dish with foil, and bake until the cheese is warm and gooey, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Serve with bread, crackers and apple and/or pear slices for dipping.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is another starter recipe.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 baguette, sliced diagonally into 1/4-inch slices (about 40 slices)</li>
      <li>&nbsp;8 ounces Brie cheese</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>&nbsp;4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, cut crosswise into 1/3-inch-wide ribbons (about 6 slices)</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Finely chopped fresh thyme leaves, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
      <li>Preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>

<h2 class="article-head">&nbsp;Apple Ginger Glazed Ham</h2>
    <p>This is a main recipe.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup apple jelly</li>
      <li>&nbsp;3 tablespoons apple butter</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar divided</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Pinch ground cloves</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2.5 lb ham</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2 cups apple juice or apple cider</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 cup apple slices</li>
    </ul>
<ol>
      
      <li>Preheat oven to 325°F.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Combine apple jelly, apple butter, 1 cup brown sugar, ginger, and cloves in small saucepan. Heat over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Continue cooking until it reduces to 1 1/2 cups and becomes syrupy and thick. Set aside.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Spray baking dish with non-stick spray. Score ham with sharp knife and set inside baking dish. Pour apple juice over ham into baking dish and place apple slices around ham. Bake ham, covered, for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Take ham out of oven and pour 1/2 of glaze over ham. Re-cover and bake another 15 minutes. Baste ham with pan juices and bake another 10 minutes, uncovered.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Take out of oven, pour another 1/4 of glaze over ham and press the 1/4 cup of brown sugar into ham.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Bake until brown sugar caramelizes and internal temperature has reached 145°F. If needed, place under broiler for 2-3 minutes. Watch closely, sugar will burn easily.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Slice and serve with remaining glaze.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 class="article-head">Parmesan Mashed Potatoes&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>This is a main recipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;3 pounds yellow potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>&nbsp;6 tablespoons butter, room temperature</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 cup 35% cream</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>&nbsp;white pepper to taste</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Placed potatoes into a large pot filled 3/4 full with cold water. Bring potatoes to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook until fork tender, 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Strain boiled potatoes returning them to the pot. Add the butter and cream. Using a potato masher, mash potatoes to desired consistency. Add a tiny bit more cream if potatoes seem too dry. Add salt and season with white pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Stir in half the quantity of cheese, mixing well to combine. Add the balance of the cheese and bring the potatoes together with a few quick strokes. Serve immediately.</li>

<h2 class="article-head">Creme Brulee&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>This is a dessert recipe.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean, split and scraped</li>
      <li>&nbsp;1 cup vanilla sugar, divided</li>
      <li>&nbsp;6 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>&nbsp;2 quarts hot water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Place the cream, vanilla bean and its pulp into a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream a little at a time, stirring continually. Pour the liquid into 6 (7 to 8-ounce) ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top. Divide the remaining 1/2 cup vanilla sugar equally among the 6 dishes and spread evenly on top. Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top. Allow the creme brulee to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
