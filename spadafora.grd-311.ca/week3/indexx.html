    <ol>
      <li>Open Dreamweaver.</li>
      <li>Create a new project, or open an existing project.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      <li>Click 'Site' at the top of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <img src="img/IMG_5195.jpeg" alt="" width="341" height="300">
      <li>Click 'New site' and give it a name.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      <img src="img/IMG_5196.jpeg" alt="" width="334" height="300">

    <h2 class="question">Explain the steps you would take to create a basic site structure. What elements are required and why?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by creating a 'route folder' on your desktop. This will serve as the main folder that will house every other folder. Give this route an appropriate name.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Next,start by creating 3 folders within the route folder called, "css", "img", and "js". These will hold images, java script, and css styling elements.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      <li>If desired, create more folders within the route to seperate desired elements further such as, weeks or pages.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Lastly, we need to create a HTML file to store in the route. This will store all of the html elements for the webpage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Open Dreamweaver, and open an existing webpage.&nbsp; click 'File' at the top of the page and click HTML, and name it "index.html".  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Use the same process to create the css file. Click 'File', and select CSS.&nbsp; Name it "main.css".&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;The 'index.html' and 'main.css' files can be put into the appropriate files within the route, such as the css folder. The 'index.html' file can be added to other folders to house other html.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;A route folder, a css, img and js folder, html file and css file are required because they create an easily acessible structure to find and organize important files.</li>
    </ul>
<img src="img/IMG_5197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275">&nbsp;This is an example of a basic site structure.&nbsp; </article>

    <ol>
      <li>Within the DOM section, on the right hand side in Dreamweaver, click on the 'body' element.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>A plus sign will appear on the left of the element. Click the '+' sign and choose an approprate action such as, insert after or insert child.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Now, a section called 'div' will appear undeneath the body element. Now you can change the name and type in 'img'.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      <li>This will create an image section within the DOM. Now you will be prompted with a screen asking to find your image within your computers files.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      <li>Once selected, it will insert into the white area on the screen. You can now change the dimensions of your image using the hamburger icon on the left on the image section.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
